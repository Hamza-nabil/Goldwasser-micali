# Goldwasser-micali
The Goldwasserâ€“Micali cryptosystem is an asymmetric key encryption algorithm developed by ShafiGoldwasser and Silvio Micali in 1982. Goldwasser-Micali has the distinction of being the first probabilistic public-key encryption scheme which is provably secure under standard cryptographic assumptions. However, it is not an efficient cryptosystem, as ciphertexts may be several hundred times larger than the initial plaintext.
